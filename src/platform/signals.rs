//! What pando does when the OS tells it to stop.
//!
//! Two answers, each installed by the part of pando that wants it. A check
//! (or a `new` mid-checkout) notes the request and unwinds through its own
//! teardown: [`catch_interrupts`] and [`interrupted`]. The TUI, whose hooks
//! run with no terminal of their own, hangs up on them before it goes:
//! [`hang_up_on_exit`], [`hang_up_now`] and the groups each
//! [`HangUpOnExit`] holds. Both handlers do nothing a signal handler may
//! not: atomics, a hang-up, and dying of the signal as pando would have.
