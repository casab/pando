/// else here pays — improve a detection rule, and every value the older,
/// worse version of it wrote stays frozen exactly as wrong as the day it
/// was written. pando records that it detected a value itself, re-derives
/// detection on every read path, and until now never compared the two: a
/// developer who upgraded saw the identical failure and had every reason
/// to think the binary was stale.
///
/// **Reported, never fixed.** Silently rewriting a value would change what
/// a developer's commands do with nobody asked, which breaks a larger
/// promise than the one it mends. So this names the key, the file, what
/// was detected, what would be detected now, and the ways to change it:
/// the command that writes what the rules offer now, and deleting the
/// line where that really reopens the question.
///
/// Three things it is careful about:
///
/// - **Only `# detected:`.** An `# answered:` value — a person's, a
///   program's, `--yes`'s — is a decision, and pando does not second-guess
///   decisions. A comment a developer wrote by hand is not one of pando's
///   notes at all and is left alone for the same reason.
/// - **Not among the candidates, rather than not the first.** Several
///   candidates can each be right, and a rule that demotes one has not
///   rejected it. Absent from the list is the signal that the rules have
///   moved — or that the repository has, which fires the same check and is
///   just as worth knowing.
/// - **Keyed by the key, not by the slot.** A dev-command candidate that
///   carries roles writes `dev.ports` beside `dev.cmd`, under the dev
///   command's own note, so "what would be written here" has to be
///   gathered across every proposal rather than from whichever slot owns
///   the key.
