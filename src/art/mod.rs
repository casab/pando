//! The first run's pictures: the PANDO wordmark, and the grove the name
//! comes from, both drawn in dithered blocks.
//!
//! Pando is one quaking aspen — some 47,000 white stems over a single root
//! system — and pando is named for it: one repository, every branch alive.
//!
//! Shaded by ordered dithering: a cell's intensity is compared with a 4×4
//! Bayer threshold and lands on one of `░▒▓█`, so gradients read as
//! texture rather than bands, in any font that has the block elements.
//!
//! Pure: the same size, frame and seed give the same cells, and only the
//! leaves and the wordmark's shine move between frames. The TUI and the
//! CLI colour the cells by their [`Material`], each from its own palette.
