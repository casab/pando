//! The way out of a refusal, said once for every front end.
//!
//! An error from `actions` reaches a person through the CLI or through the
//! TUI, and the TUI shows it verbatim. So the remedy in it is phrased as
//! what to do — "start it on the project's shared services" — never as a
//! flag, which means nothing on a screen with no command line. The CLI,
//! where a flag *is* the way to do it, rewrites each phrase into its flag
//! form with [`for_cli`] before printing, so a message there is exactly as
//! actionable as it was.
//!
//! One row per remedy: a message that needs one names the constant, never
//! a copy of its text, or the rewrite would silently stop matching.

/// One way out, in both of its spellings.
