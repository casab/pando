//! CLI remedies rewritten as the TUI keys that do the same thing.
//!
//! An action's error ends with what to do next, and the actions are shared
//! with the CLI, so that advice is sometimes a flag: `pass --force`,
//! `start without --isolated`. In the TUI nobody types a flag. Each row
//! below is one phrase and the key that stands for it; a phrase the
//! actions no longer use simply never matches, so the table can only go
//! stale, never break a message.

/// Phrase, replacement. Longest first where one contains another, so the
/// specific rewrite wins over the general one.
