//! TUI state and the key handlers.
//!
//! Two rules from the origin tool are carried unchanged, because breaking
//! either one is immediately visible to the user:
//!
//! - Nothing reachable from here calls a blocking `.status()` or a bare
//!   `.spawn()` that inherits the terminal. A child that writes to the
//!   terminal paints over the alternate screen.
//! - No git or network call runs inline in a key handler. They all run on a
//!   worker thread and report back as an `AppEvent`, or the frame freezes.
//!
//! `App` and its core key dispatch live here; the rest of its methods are
//! split by concern across the submodules, each adding its own `impl App`.
