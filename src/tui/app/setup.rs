//! The setup screen: what the first `pando` in a new project shows in
//! place of the dashboard, and the ready view it turns into.
//!
//! It follows pando's own files, never the agent: the four files whose
//! change can move the setup along are polled on the tick, by their
//! modification times, while the screen is up. A config file that
//! changed is re-read on a worker, as `config_now` lists the worktrees;
//! a check record that changed is re-read on the spot, being two small
//! files and a lock asked without waiting. Nothing here starts a check in
//! the TUI: `v` starts `pando check` as a detached child, and the screen
//! watches its record like any other check's.
//!
//! `⏎` with no settings lets pando try its own guess: the guess is worked
//! out on a worker, written by `actions`, and tested by the same detached
//! check, so the single action slot is never the setup's.
