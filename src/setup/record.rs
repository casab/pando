//! The two files pando keeps about a project's setup: the last check's
//! record (`check.json`) and what the setup screen remembers
//! (`setup.json`).
//!
//! Both are read tolerantly: a file that is missing, unreadable or of a
//! shape this pando does not know reads as "none", never as an error, so a
//! damaged file costs a retest and nothing else. Both are written the way
//! `state.json` is, to a temp file renamed over the old one, so a reader
//! on the TUI's tick never sees half a record.
