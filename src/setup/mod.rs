//! A project's setup: whether pando is set up and tested for it, and the
//! one line that hands the job to the developer's own coding agent.
//!
//! Read from files pando owns — the config layers, the last check's
//! record, and what the setup screen remembers — never from the
//! repository. [`read`] decides one of seven [`SetupState`]s, in order:
//! a check running, the last one interrupted, nothing to run yet, then the
//! last check against today's run settings, compared by [`fingerprint`].
//! What a check stores of a failed process's log goes through
//! [`redact_line`] first. [`memory_block`] is what an agent keeps about
//! running the project once it is set up, and pando's own copies of it.
