//! Colour themes: the palette the interface paints with, which theme it
//! comes from, and whether its dark or light half.
//!
//! A theme is data — a TOML file in `theme/builtin/`, or the developer's
//! own under `<pando home>/themes/`, which replaces a built-in of the same
//! name. It gives a background, a foreground and seven accents for each
//! appearance, and every other colour is mixed from those
//! ([`palette`](self::palette)) — an eighth accent, `namespaced`, included
//! — so a new theme is nine lines a side.
//!
//! Which one applies: `PANDO_THEME`, then the file `[ui] theme_from`
//! names (a terminal theme switcher's state file, followed while pando
//! runs), then `[ui] theme`, then `pando`. Dark or light: `PANDO_APPEARANCE`,
//! then `[ui] appearance`, then the system.
//!
//! Each colour means one thing, everywhere, so a colour learnt in one place
//! reads the same in the next. A new use picks the row it belongs to:
//!
//! | colour       | means                                              |
//! |--------------|----------------------------------------------------|
//! | `green`      | up, working, done: running, a success, a public    |
//! |              | URL, an open pull request                          |
//! | `yellow`     | in flight, or needs a look: starting, uncommitted  |
//! | `red`        | failed, down, destructive                          |
//! | `cyan`       | an address: a URL, a port                          |
//! | `magenta`    | isolated: private copies of the services; a merged |
//! |              | pull request, as GitHub colours it                 |
//! | `namespaced` | namespaced: a namespace of the worktree's own in   |
//! |              | the project's servers. Mixed from magenta and blue |
//! |              | when a theme does not name it                      |
//! | `blue`       | where you are: the cursor, the checked-out branch  |
//! | `orange`     | a key to press                                     |
//! | `text`       | what the row is about: a branch, a title           |
//! | `text_dim`   | a value that is there but not news                 |
//! | `text_muted` | labels, titles, hints: read once, then skipped     |
//! | `border`     | lines: borders and the grid                        |
//!
//! Colour never carries a meaning alone: a glyph or a word says it too,
//! for whoever cannot tell two of them apart.
//!
//! Log lines are coloured as they are read, so after a switch the lines
//! already on screen keep the old theme's colours until they are read
//! again.
