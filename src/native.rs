//! The native adapter: a private database without a container.
//!
//! The compose adapter in `services.rs` isolates a worktree by giving it
//! its own compose project; this one gives it its own *process*. A recipe
//! says what initialises a data directory, what starts the server on a
//! port pando allocated, and how to tell when it is ready; everything else
//! — the role, the env rewriting, the log tab, the teardown — is the same
//! machinery either kind of service goes through.
//!
//! Four things here are decisions rather than mechanics:
//!
//! - **The data directory is initialised once, and never re-initialised.**
//!   A marker inside it records that pando did so. A directory that
//!   already holds data and has no marker is *adopted*, because running
//!   `initdb` over a real cluster would destroy it. An init that fails
//!   takes the directory it was making with it, so the next start is a
//!   clean retry rather than an adoption of a half-built wreck.
//! - **The socket directory is a fixed-length path in the temporary
//!   directory.** `sun_path` is 104 bytes; pando's own data directory path
//!   is most of that before the branch name is interesting. See
//!   [`crate::paths::PandoPaths::service_socket_dir`].
//! - **`<pando home>/bin` is prepended to PATH for every recipe command.**
//!   The same hook the docker shim uses, and for the same two reasons: a
//!   developer whose Postgres is not on the PATH a login shell resolves
//!   has somewhere to put a shim, and the tests drive a fake engine per
//!   test home without mutating the process environment. It is prepended
//!   *inside* the command, after the login profile has run, so nothing the
//!   profile does can undo it.
//! - **Readiness is gated on a connect.** The recipe's own check is a
//!   process spawn through a login shell; asking four times a second for a
//!   minute is expensive for an answer a TCP connect can rule out for
//!   free. Nothing listening means not ready, without asking.
//!
//! Stopping is not here. `stop` and `rm` never load config, so they have
//! no recipe to read — they signal the process group, which is the one
//! thing that works whatever the recipe said, and is why the pid and the
//! pgid go into `ServiceRecord` before anything is waited on.
